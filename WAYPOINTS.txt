	· add a git branching concept
		· READ: https://git-scm.com/book/de/v1/Git-Branching-Einfaches-Branching-und-Merging

	· switch to JSHint
	· check rotation performance, might have direct impact on the game concept 
	· how do I revert to a certain commit?
	· move the object by keys
	· add other objects

	· come up with a concept for a GUI
		· divs in front of the canvas?
